Description: # saga
        
        saga is a set of tools for version control. As a user, you can use saga to manage any project... TODO.
        
        As a developer, you can use saga's framework to add intelligent version control to any software project. Simply tell saga what your file looks like, and saga will auto-magically allow git-level branching, patching, and merging. Oh gee, think of the collaboration possible!
