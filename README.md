# saga

Saga is a version control CLI like inspired by Git. Unlike Git, it is designed to work for file formats other than text. TL;DR: imagine if you could merge your Excel files too. 

If you want to use Saga to manage your creative projects (code, design, excel, etc), you can install the tool with:

~~~~
pip3 install saga-vcs
~~~~

If you want to add version control to a file format saga does not currently support, you can see examples of doing so [here](https://github.com/saga-vcs/saga/blob/master/saga/file_types/text_file.py) and [here](https://github.com/saga-vcs/saga/blob/master/saga/file_types/excel_file.py). Documentation coming soon!

## Installation Instructions

To install the `saga` command line tool, run:

~~~~
pip3 install saga-vcs
~~~~

Currently, Saga only works on macOS and maybe Linux. Windows support coming eventually!

## Using saga

Currently, the `saga` command line tool has a very similar interface to Git. The following commands are currently supported:

~~~~
saga init
saga add 
saga commit
saga log
saga status
saga branch
saga checkout
saga merge
saga push
saga pull
~~~~

Some commands don't perform exactly as Git does, so watch out! 

## Warning

Saga is pre-alpha software. Do not use saga to manage any files that you don't totally trust (we are sure there are security vulnerabilities hanging about).
